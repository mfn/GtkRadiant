- add browse buttons to CGameInstall dialog for engine folder

- copy content, only generating the .game atm

- delete .game files? should we also delete files that were copied?

- when doing Q3 + mod, the mod has to be setup in the preferences
(that's a bit awkward)

- the game list reload doesn't work right, the entries in the combo probably need to be initialized again

- add GUI pref to allow change font for views (currently must be done by hand in local.conf -> "GlFont")

- group entries in NEWS file? currently it's chronically
